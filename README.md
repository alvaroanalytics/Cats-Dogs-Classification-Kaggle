# 🐱🐶 Cats & Dogs Classification – Kaggle

This project tackles a classic **image classification** task using the **Kaggle Cats & Dogs dataset**.  
It involves:

- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Building and training a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** with Keras & TensorFlow
- Model evaluation and performance visualization
- Experimentation with dropout, batch normalization, and learning rate tuning

The notebook is fully annotated and aimed at exploring core deep learning techniques applied to computer vision.
